# Various SCM scripts for Gimp updated to at least version 2.10, some to 2.99
Various SCM scripts for Gimp updated to at least version 2.10, some to 2.99

Attention the filters for 2.99.16 do not always work on 2.99.18

If you use versions of Gimp equal to or higher than 2.99 the code for previous Gimp versions must be updated.

The scripts in this repo try to support Gimp 2.10 and possibly the latest 2.99.xx.

Now some scripts are fixed to run independently of others... there was a hidden dependency.

If a script-fu doesn't work, trash it.
