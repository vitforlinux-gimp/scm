# Various SCM scripts for Gimp updated to at least version 2.10, some to 3.0
Various SCM scripts for Gimp updated to at least version 2.10, some to 3.0 (300 in file name).

Attention the filters are for 2.10 or 3.0, need fresh install, old releases are left in the repo for study purposes.

If you use versions of Gimp equal to or higher than 2.99 the code for previous Gimp versions must be updated.

The scripts in this repo try to support Gimp 2.10 and possibly the latest 3.0 (300 in file name).

These script-fu work if placed in the scripts folder of the Gimp configuration files. Not in the plugins folder.

In many scripts the fonts have been replaced with fonts under the OFL or GPL license. The downloader can be found here:
https://github.com/vitforlinux-gimp/font-downloader... There is also a collection of GPL or OFL fonts in .zip in the releases.

Now some scripts are fixed to run independently of others... there was a hidden dependency.

If a script-fu doesn't work, trash it.
